# AVDASI 2 Team A
Home For all Things Awesome in AVDASI 2 Team A

Welcome to the GitHub repository for all things to do with AVDASI 2 Team A work. Team members should feel free to make as many additions and changes to this repository as they feel necessary. All changes will be assessed and confirmed by a relevant member of the committee team.

Code for the flap control mechanism can be found within the Ctrl folder. There are three sets of code within these folders: Master, Prototype and Experimental. 'Experimental' code usually tests specific features and/or electronics setups. 'Prototype' code is the code specifically associated with running the prototype tabletop demonstrator model. Finally, the code that will be integrated into the wing will be added to the 'Master' folder.

For any questions please email (in this order):
