# AVDASI 2 Team A
Home For all Things Awesome in AVDASI 2 Team A

Welcome to the GitHub repository for all things to do with AVDASI 2 Team A work. Team members should feel free to make as many additions and changes to this repository as they feel necessary. All changes will be assessed and confirmed by a relevant member of the committee team.

In case you are wondering how to work with git, a good guide can be found [here](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

Code for the flap control mechanism can be found within the ACTCTRL folder. There are three different code branches associated with this project. 'Experimental' code usually contains code for specific features and/or electronics setups, plus raw edits to the main code files. The 'Prototype' branch is specifically associated with running the prototype tabletop demonstrator model. Finally, the code that will be integrated into the final wing build will be added to the 'Master' branch. Code will be periodically organised into 'releases' to give an idea of the progression of the project.

Latest release is: v0.17.12.03
